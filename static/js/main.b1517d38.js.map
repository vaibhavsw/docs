Remember that the key on which you are performing\r\n                    join must have a relationship.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2 id=\"/rest/guides/datastore/query/logical-ops\">Logical Operators</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Datastore provides several logical operators to query documents. Logical operators allow defining\r\n                    multiple criteria and datastore matches the documents fulfilling the operator and the query\r\n                    criteria.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Retrieving previously saved documents, we are querying all the documents which either have a value\r\n                    of key <TextHighlight>remind</TextHighlight> as <TextHighlight>true</TextHighlight> or\r\n                    <TextHighlight>false</TextHighlight>. The same can be achieved using the\r\n                    <TextHighlight>OR</TextHighlight> logical operator in the query, as shown in the sample query below:\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <Code>{codes.logicalOperators}</Code>\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.logicalOperatorsResponse}\r\n                </Code>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Other logical operators can be used in the same way as shown above, and the result will be affected\r\n                    accordingly. Element operators can also be used with logical operators if needed.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    When using a logical operator to retrieve documents, datastore returns the collection of documents,\r\n                    since it performs matches on multiple documents. If the element operator\r\n                    <TextHighlight>findUnique</TextHighlight> is applied datastore will return the first document\r\n                    matching the query which is not the expected result when\r\n                    using Logical Operators.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2 id=\"/rest/guides/datastore/query/embed\">Querying Embedded Documents</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    To specify a condition on a field in an embedded document, use the <TextHighlight>dot\r\n                    notation</TextHighlight>. For example, retrieving a document <TextHighlight>notes</TextHighlight>\r\n                    where the value of <TextHighlight>tag</TextHighlight> key in the\r\n                    <TextHighlight>content</TextHighlight> document equals <TextHighlight>important</TextHighlight>.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.queryEmbedDocument}\r\n                </Code>\r\n\r\n                <Callout>\r\n                    In the query, <TextHighlight>content.tag</TextHighlight> is used to target the embedded document\r\n                    key.\r\n                </Callout>\r\n\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.queryEmbedDocumentResposne}\r\n                </Code>\r\n            </Section>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/docs/platform/rest/QueryingDocuments.js","import Section from '../../../components/Section';\r\nimport Callout from '../../../components/Callout';\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport default class QuickStart extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <Section>\r\n                <h1 id=\"/docs/rest/guides/start\">Quick Start</h1>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Vostics Cloud is an automated cloud computing platform providing end-to-end solutions for your\r\n                    project whether it is a Mobile app, Web app or Desktop app.\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    <br/>\r\n                    Our platform offers products required by all modern apps, like a pre-hosted database, user\r\n                    authentication, file storage, and messaging.

You can do that by sending a query that\r\n                    matches the embedded document you want to update and data along with it. For example, here we are\r\n                    updating an embedded document whose <TextHighlight>date</TextHighlight> key under document\r\n                    <TextHighlight>notes</TextHighlight> must have value <TextHighlight>equal</TextHighlight> to\r\n                    <TextHighlight>12\r\n                        February 2015</TextHighlight>. Notice <TextHighlight>query</TextHighlight> uses <TextHighlight>dot\r\n                    notation</TextHighlight> to match the embed document.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.updateEmbedDocumentValues}\r\n                </Code>\r\n\r\n                <h2 id=\"/rest/guides/datastore/update/link\">Update Linked Document</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Updating linked documents requires the <TextHighlight>_id</TextHighlight> key present in the JSON\r\n                    body matching the document you\r\n                    want to update. If the relationship between documents is of type\r\n                    <TextHighlight>Many-to-Many</TextHighlight>, datastore requires\r\n                    you to send the <TextHighlight>_id</TextHighlight> of <TextHighlight>parent document</TextHighlight>\r\n                    in JSON body otherwise the child document will not be\r\n                    updated. For example, here we are updating one of the <TextHighlight>book</TextHighlight> documents\r\n                    linked with the <TextHighlight>author</TextHighlight> document\r\n                    with a Many-to-Many relationship. Child document which we want to update has the\r\n                    <TextHighlight>_id</TextHighlight> key present in\r\n                    JSON body.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.updateLinkedDocument}\r\n                </Code>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    In the same way, you can update child documents with any kind of relationships.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    When the relationship between documents is of <TextHighlight>One-to-Many</TextHighlight> or\r\n                    <TextHighlight>Many-to-Many</TextHighlight>, you may want to add more\r\n                    children to the parent document. You can achieve that by sending a\r\n                    <TextHighlight>PUT</TextHighlight> request to the document with\r\n                    the request body same as the saving document and the rest would be handled by datastore. For\r\n                    example, we are adding a <TextHighlight>note</TextHighlight> to <TextHighlight>users</TextHighlight>\r\n                    document:\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.oneToManyAndManyToManyUpdate}\r\n                </Code>\r\n\r\n                <h2 id=\"/rest/guides/datastore/update/keys\">Delete Keys</h2>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    You can also delete keys from the document.

For example, we are deleting the keys\r\n                    &nbsp;<TextHighlight>remind</TextHighlight> and <TextHighlight>date</TextHighlight> from all\r\n                    documents:\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.deleteKey}\r\n                </Code>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Response will be 200 OK and contains JSON body with key <TextHighlight>modified</TextHighlight>\r\n                    mentioning the number of document\r\n                    affected with the request.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <Code>\r\n                    {codes.deleteKeyResponse}\r\n                </Code>\r\n            </Section>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/docs/platform/rest/UpdatingDocument.js","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './container/App';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <App />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/index.js","\"use strict\";\n\n/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
